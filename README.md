# ikea-standing-desk-wifi

A standing desk is a fun thing to use in a smart home. Sadly there are not many wifi enabled devices available. This script turns a bluetooth IKEA linak standing desk into a wifi standing desk. It does so by providing the power to control the desk. Install the script on a raspberry pi/ intel NUC and you'll be able to communicate with your desk, from anywhere you want. This way, you're able to break the limits of bluetooth range.

Set-up: 

- pair your computer with the bluetooth device
- install the script using a virtual environment/docker
- run the application

- have fun (-:
